### Howdy 👋

My name is Daniel. I'm one of those rare developers who doesn't drink coffee ☕ But I like pizza 🍕😋

- Creative geek and fiery soul 🤓🔥 Living in Denmark 🤍❤
- AP Graduate in _Computer Science_ 👨‍💻 (2020)
- Currently studying a bachelor's degree in _Innovation and Entrepreneurship_ 📚

I try to be open minded and embrace most technologies and tools, but I have a particular penchant for JavaScript and for building responsive/adaptive layouts 💘 I can work full stack, but my forces are clearly in the front-end part.
