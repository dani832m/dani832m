### Who is 'dani832m' and why such an ugly handle?

First of all, I'm one of those rare developers who doesn't drink coffee ☕ But I like pizza 🍕😋

- Creative geek and fiery soul 🤓🔥 Living in Denmark 🤍❤
- AP Graduate in _Computer Science_ 👨‍💻 (2020)
- Currently studying a bachelor's degree in _Innovation and Entrepreneurship_ 📚

I try to be open minded and embrace most technologies and tools, but I have a particular penchant for JavaScript and for building responsive/adaptive layouts 💘 I can work full stack, but my forces are clearly in the front-end part.

My handle was originally my username at my educational institution, and I just chose to use it when I created my GitHub profile back in 2017. Subsequently, it just hung on, and now it has become too cumbersome to have to change it due to various links in repoes, wikies etc. 😁
