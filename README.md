### Who is 'dani832m' and why such an ugly handle?

First of all, I'm one of those rare developers who doesn't drink coffee ☕ But I like pizza 🍕😋

- Creative geek and fiery soul 🤓🔥 Living in Denmark 🤍❤
- AP Graduate in Computer Science 👨‍💻 (2020)
- Currently studying a bachelor's degree in Innovation and Entrepreneurship 📚

I try to be open minded and embrace most technologies and tools, but I have a particular fondness for JavaScript, which I like to incorporate into my projects if possible. I can work full stack, but my forces are clearly in the front end part.

My handle is originally my username for my educational institution, and I just chose to use it when I created my GitHub profile back in 2017. Subsequently, it just hung on, and now it has become too cumbersome to have to change it due to various links in repoes, wikies etc. 😁
